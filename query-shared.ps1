# PowerShell Script to Search Through Various Directories Including Shared File System, SharePoint, and OneNote

# Prompt the user for a search pattern
$searchPattern = Read-Host "Enter the search pattern (e.g., '*.docx' for Word documents)"

# Verify if the user has entered a search pattern, if not, provide a default one
if (-not $searchPattern) {
    $searchPattern = "*.docx" # Default search pattern
    Write-Output "No search pattern entered. Using default: $searchPattern"
} else {
    Write-Output "Searching for files matching pattern: $searchPattern"
}

# ----- Search in a Shared File System -----
# Define the absolute path to the shared file system directory
$sharedFileSystemPath = "\\server\shared\path"
# Using Get-ChildItem to search through the directory with the user-defined pattern
Get-ChildItem -Path $sharedFileSystemPath -Recurse -Filter $searchPattern |
    ForEach-Object {
        # Output the path of each file found
        Write-Output "Found in Shared File System: $($_.FullName)"
    }

# ----- Search in an Online SharePoint Directory -----
# Placeholder for SharePoint directory path
#$sharePointDirectoryPath = "https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite/Shared Documents"
# Note to replace this section with actual SharePoint API calls, passing the $searchPattern as part #of the query
#Write-Output "To search in SharePoint directory at '$sharePointDirectoryPath' with pattern #'$searchPattern', API calls to SharePoint Online are required. This is a placeholder."

# ----- Search in Microsoft OneNote -----
# Placeholder for OneNote root directory path
#$oneNoteRootDirectory = "https://www.onenote.com/api/v1.0/me/notes"
# Note to replace this section with actual OneNote API calls, passing the $searchPattern as part of #the query
#Write-Output "To search in OneNote at '$oneNoteRootDirectory' with pattern '$searchPattern', API #calls to OneNote are required. This is a placeholder."

# Note: The actual implementation for searching in SharePoint and OneNote would involve using their respective APIs
# or SDKs to query directories or notebooks with the user-defined search pattern.
